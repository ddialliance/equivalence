# September 23, 2024 Kickoff Meeting
 Attendees:
- Dan Smith
- Wendy Thomas
- MiYoung Choi
- Jeremy Iverson

## Quick recap

The DDI RDF Equivalence Working Group was introduced, with participants expressing their interest in the RDF equivalence mappings for DDI products. The group discussed the need for a common list of classes across various DDI products, represented in RDF, and the potential for mapping common classes to non-DDI ontologies. The setup for the group was also discussed, including the creation of a Github work group page and the planning of a next steps.

## Next steps
- Wendy and Flavio to review and submit their previous work on identifying common classes and levels using the standardized submission process.
- Dan to set up a process for the group to submit, discuss, and approve equivalence requests using GitHub issues. Create SSSOM examples.
- All members to begin creating a list of common classes across different DDI products, starting with high-level mappings.

# Meeting summary

## DDI RDF Equivalence Working Group Kickoff

The meeting was a kickoff for the DDI RDF Equivalence Working Group. Participants included Dan, Wendy, MiYoung, and Jeremy. They introduced themselves and shared their interest in the group, particularly in the RDF equivalence mappings for DDI products. Wendy, with extensive experience in DDI, emphasized the importance of these mappings for easier content transformation and querying. MiYoung expressed her curiosity about the RDF system. Jeremy from Colectica also shared his interest in the idea of equivalence mappings for different standards. Dan ended the conversation by outlining the group's plan, which was initiated in 2022 during a DDI Technical Committee meeting.

## Creating Common Class List for DDI Products

Dan led a discussion about the need for a common list of classes across various DDI products, represented in RDF, including SDTL, XKOS, DDI Lifecycle version 4, and the upcoming DDI CDI model. The goal is to create a high-level mapping of these classes to facilitate the use of similar content across different products. The team also considered the possibility of mapping common classes to non-DDI ontologies, such as [schema.org](https://schema.org), but decided to focus initially on creating the common class list.  

## Setting Up Github Work Group and Equivalence Requests  

Dan discussed the setup for the group, including the creation of a Github work group page and the planning of the groups processes. He proposed a timeline for the group to submit and approve equivalence requests, suggesting the use of the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings to document these equivalents. Wendy suggested that the submission process should include descriptions and labels of objects, and that commonalities and differences should be considered. Dan also mentioned the potential for aligning high-level properties across different products. The team agreed to further discuss these ideas and consider the work already done by Wendy and Flavio.
