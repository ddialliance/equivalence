## Quick recap

The team reviewed the proposed work process for creating mappings between DDI RDF products and discussed the approval of new RDF equivalencies, focusing on establishing a common ontology to map classes and properties across different DDI products. They outlined a review process for mapping ontologies and agreed on procedures for handling proposed changes, including documentation requirements and the use of pull requests for asynchronous reviews. The group discussed the prioritization of mapping DDI standards to RDF representations, with plans to start with the DDI Common Core as the first milestone and potentially expand to other DDI products and schema.org in the future.

## Next steps

- Dan: Pull out key highlights from the meeting, specify requirements for additions/change requests (including showing definitions of different items), and create a list of what's required for reviewing pull requests; send this out to the list with the minutes
- Wendy: Review the revised Common Core document to ensure no changes in text for the three areas discussed and report back to Dan
- Dan: Send a follow-up email and post the minutes
- Consider removing the generated folder from the Git repository (pending group consensus, but noted as a likely action)

# Summary

## DDI RDF Mapping Process Review

The meeting focused on reviewing the proposed work process for creating mappings between DDI RDF products and discussing the approval of new RDF equivalencies. Dan explained the current mapping process, which involves using a common ontology to map classes and properties between DDI lifecycle and DDI CDI. He demonstrated how the TSV files are edited to add new class mappings and how properties can also be mapped. The goal is to enable Sparql  queries to work across multiple DDI products by establishing equivalencies between different representations.

## DDI Ontology Development Initiative

The team discussed the development of a common ontology for DDI products, focusing on mapping classes and properties from different DDI products to create a unified model. They agreed to start with classes from the DDI Common Core and ISO document as the first milestone, with plans to add mappings for lifecycle, CDI, SDTL, and potentially codebook and XCOS in the future. Wendy suggested creating documentation to help content creators understand equivalent terms across products. The team also discussed the need for a review process for new definitions added to the common ontology.

## Ontology Mapping Review Framework

The group discussed the review process for mapping ontologies, with Wendy outlining a framework that includes both technical and comprehension reviews. They also considered how to handle additions or changes to mappings, with Dan presenting an example of a proposed change to add unit types. The team agreed to discuss the required information for such requests, including details about the mapping, products involved, and reasons for the addition. They also touched on the question of whether generated content should be committed to the Git repository, leaving this as a separate discussion for later.

## Streamlining Review Process Through Pull Requests

The team discussed the review process for proposed changes, focusing on how to present information for review and the need for multiple reviewers. They agreed that pull request descriptions should include relevant descriptions from existing documentation, and that most reviews could be handled asynchronously through pull requests rather than requiring scheduled meetings. The group decided to encourage self-motivated review work rather than relying on scheduled meetings, with Wendy suggesting periodic calendar checks as an alternative.

## Google Docs and ISO Updates

Dan agreed to send Wendy a list of people to add to the Google Docs, and they discussed the need to update the operating procedures. Guillaume mentioned his return to INSEE and inquired about the core common model, which Dan and Wendy confirmed is the document to be published as the ISO. Wendy noted that Gillman had made editorial changes to the Common Core based on the first review, with no significant content changes.

## DDI Standards RDF Mapping Initiative

The team discussed mapping DDI standards to RDF representations, focusing on five DDI products: Codebook, Lifecycle, XKOS, SDTL, and SDTH. They agreed to prioritize mapping the DDI Common Core (ISO standard) to the common ontology as a first milestone, followed by creating mappings to other DDI products and potentially schema.org. Dan proposed removing generated mappings from the Git repository and using the actions to create and download archives instead. Wendy agreed to review the revised document for any changes in key areas. The team expressed excitement about starting work on mappings between CDI and Lifecycle, now that the lifecycle beta is nearly finalized.
